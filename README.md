# github_search
This is to track repos by language for a first time learner of it

# The idea
When you first time learn a programming language, you want to practice. Besides the github api been complicated you want to have the best way to find good repo and still not having any library or framework envolved that send you back to learning rather than immediately getting your hands dirty.

# Usage
This actually can be used only on Linux but hopefully it could be used on Windows on the future.
copy all the files in your web directory, make sure to have proper permissions of write in that folder, and of execute to the shell script github_search.sh.
and enjoy.

# Contributing
I've tried my best to fullfill the goal above that is finding good quality projects that doesn't involve any frameworks, but I don't think it's my fault rather than just it's just that way, the repos that have a pure language are not good quality, and good quality projects tends to reuse code.

If you think otherwise and have a way to help improve finding good quality code in pure language, than please you are more than welcome to suggest a way to find it or directly contributing to the code

There are also some points to be improved in the file next.txt, you can contribute too

If you have any suggestions or contribution you're welcome too, I myself was a begginer and wrote this to help myself finding a project to contribute to, and end up beeng busy with it. So that means this needs a lot of improvements. So they are welcome of any kind.
